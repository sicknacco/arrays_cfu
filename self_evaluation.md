## Self Evaluation

1. I feel fairly confident with the content of Arrays so far. This lesson definitely went quicker than the last. It is shocking to see how many different Array methods there are!

2. I feel that I am in a good spot right now. Of course who couldn't use a little more time in the day to work on things but I feel good. I'd like to go back to Conditionals and get that "password" example done. I have a feeling I am over thinking it.

3. Why is there different syntax for Arrays in irb vs VS code?
